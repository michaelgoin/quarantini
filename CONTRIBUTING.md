# Contributing to Quarantini

Thank you for contributing to the project.

This is a new project, starting with reasonably light guidelines. Feel free to submit a pull request with any suggestions or changes to consider for this document.

## Code of Conduct

Please acquaint yourself with the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

By participating in this project, you are expected to uphold the code of conduct. Any unacceptable behavior should be reported to quarantini.project@gmail.com.

## New Issues

### Bugs

Please leave a clear description of the issue as well as reproduction steps. An example test case can be a great way to indicate expected behavior, the current behavior and give a clear path forward for a fix.

Even better, follow-up with a PR to resolve the issue. :)

### Features

Please clearly define the use case and expected behavior. Given the nature of this project, code examples will likely be extremely helpful. If a feature is considered potentially too specific to a specific person or company, reasonable aggregation of :+1: on the issue may be necessary before it moves forward.

Similar to bugs, follow-up PR's are extremely welcome. You may want to confirm interest/have a discussion via issue first to avoid wasting effort.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are very welcome. Similar to issues, a clear description of what is being solved is important. When there's an accompanying issue, most of the details can remain in the issue itself.

For code-related changes, accompanying tests will be a requirement for the PR to land. Is absolutely OK to start with an idea of a code change and ask for help as how to approach testing.

Documentation related pull requests are also always welcome, including adding new docs.
